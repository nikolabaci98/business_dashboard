# Introduction
## Data
In this notebook you will be presented with an exploratory analysis of the
license applications in the NYC metropolitan area.
The data is downloaded from NYC Open Data and it could be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/License-Applications/ptev-4hud).

## Business Owner
If you want to to open a business and you would like to be one step ahead of your
competition, then this analysis is for your. Here you will find out how long 
on average would take for your to get your license, where your competition is
located, how far has your industry has grown and a forecast on where the 
direction of this growth in the next 2 years.

## DCWP
This analysis is also intended to help the Department of Consumer and Worker
Protection (DCWP) on creating an overview of their data and improve their daily and
seasonal operations.

# Data and Methods

The data set is retrieved from NYC Open Data which is an evolving set as DCWP is
updating it weekly. The data set was made available at first in January 2016 and
has grown into almost half a million cases. The data set has over 25 features
(columns) but the columns that I paid the most interest in are the license category,
date the license was issued as well as the geo-location of the businesses.

This analysis is primary descriptive with the main focus being the understanding 
patterns and gathering insights on past observations. At the end you will also
find a forecasting model for the next 2 years.

# Analysis, Results and Interpretations
## Import the data

The zipcode data is to provide a unified pairing between zipcode and county because 
counties differ depending on what the applicant wrote which might not be correct.

We also do some cleaning of the column names and subset the data.
The data that we will focus is all the licenses that are issued in the 5 boroughs
in NYC.

```{r Data-Import}

license_applications <-  read.csv("data.csv")
zipcodes <- read.csv("zipcodes.csv")

names(zipcodes) <- tolower(gsub("[.]", "_", names(zipcodes)))
zipcodes <- rename(zipcodes, zip = zip_code, city = common_cities)
zipcodes$zip <- as.character(zipcodes$zip)


df_orig <- license_applications

df_orig <- df_orig %>%
  select(Application.ID:End.Date, License.Category, Application.Category, City:Latitude)

#change names
names(df_orig) <- tolower(gsub("[.]", "_", names(df_orig)))
zipcodes <- select(zipcodes, -type)


df <- df_orig

#Limit the analysis of only businesses in from NY with an valid issued licence
df <- df %>%
  filter(state == "NY") %>%
  filter(status == "Issued") %>%
  mutate(contact_phone = case_when(contact_phone == "" ~ NA_character_,
                                   TRUE ~ contact_phone)) %>%
  mutate(end_date = mdy(end_date), start_date = mdy(start_date))

# Join the tables and remove duplicated columns
df <- df %>%
  left_join(zipcodes, by ="zip") %>%
  select(-city.x) %>%
  rename(city = city.y) %>%
  filter(!duplicated(application_id)) %>%
  filter(county %in% c("Queens County", "Bronx County","Kings County", "Richmond County", "New York County"))

```


## Understanding the dataset

Looking at only the 5 boroughs, the data shrinks by almost 90K observations which 
are licenses issued on other counties upstate or in Long Island.

About a third (see below) of those observations do not have either contact_phone, and/or longitude,
and/or latitude data. The last two can be approximated using the full business 
physical address, but this will be left as an add-on improvement feature.

```{r}

# check for duplicates
colSums(is.na(df) / nrow(df))
```

## Top 10 Zipcodes
Here are 10 zip codes with the most licenses issued. The first-place zip code is located
in Queens County, while Kings County has more zip codes in the top ten places.

```{r, fig.show='hide', message=FALSE}
df %>%
  group_by(zip, county) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  top_n(10) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(fct_reorder(zip, count), count)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Zips") +
  ggtitle("Top 10 zipcodes by number of applications")

```

## Overall Distribution

Investigating the total number of issued licenses over the years, we see an
enormous jump from 2013 with roughly 10,000 licenses to 2014 with almost 40,000
licenses issued. Did people become more entrepreneurial in just one year? Or is this
some anomaly with the data?

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
df %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(year(end_date))) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Number of Applications 2000-2023")
  
```

## What is going on?

As you can see from the table below, the majority of the licenses issued before 2014
regarded the Tobacco shops, and the rest of the categories had very little records.

Either NY passed a law that required businesses to have a license to operate (a hypothesis
I could not prove due to the lack of information online) or New Yorkers embarked on what
seems to be an entrepreneurial journey that continues to thrive despite Covid-19 pandemic.
However, the second option is highly unlikely due to very low number and limited categories
as seen in the table

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(year(end_date) < 2014) %>% 
  group_by(license_category) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  f
```


## Processing Time

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) seems to be very
efficient with the applications since half of the applications are closed
only one day after the application is submitted, 75% of applications are 
closed not later than 3 days, and 98.5% of all the applications is closed 
within 3 months.

By looking at the table below, we can see in descending order the license 
categories that take the most time to get processed and issued. 

Pedicab businesses take the most time on average to get a license with about 
34-35 days to get a license. The second category that takes the longest for a 
license issued are the Tow Truck companies at 31 days and then the Car Wash 
businesses at 17 days. 

This time is highly possible to be due to applicant submitting an incomplete
application and need to retain those documents before the license is issued.

```{r}
# create the data frame
period <- df %>%
  filter(end_date >= start_date) %>% #some data have a end_date before start_date
  filter(year(end_date) > 2013) %>% #only look at data from 2014 and on
  mutate(days = as.integer(end_date - start_date)) #calculate the days

# Quartiles and min/max
summary(period$days)

# % of issued licenses before 3 months = 98.5%
nrow(filter(period, days < 90)) / nrow(period)

# table the top 10 slowest
period %>%
  group_by(license_category) %>%
  summarise(days = median(days)) %>%
  arrange(desc(days)) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  gt()

```

## Distribution for every year

Below are the graphs from 2014 to 2022 with the total applications submitted for
each month (bars-left y axis) and the average timeto process for each month 
(red line - right y axis). Generally,the distributions are bimodal, which lets 
us know that the winter months are the busiest for the DCWP.


```{r, fig.show='hide'}
over_months <- df %>%
  filter(year(start_date) > 2013, year(start_date) < 2023) %>%
  mutate(year = year(start_date), month = month(start_date, label = T)) %>%
  mutate(days = as.integer(end_date - start_date)) %>%
  filter(days > 0) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), avg = mean(days)) %>%
  ungroup()


over_months %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = month, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = avg * 100 , group = 1), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous("Applications Count", 
                     breaks = seq(0, 10000, 2000),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . /100, name = "Average Days")) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ggtitle("Year by Year Distribution and Average Processing Time") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

## Forecasting Until 2025

In this last analysis piece, I fit the data through the Holt-Winter's exponential
smoothing forecasting model with the indent to capture the number of applications
in the next 2 years to come. The solid blue line represents the mean, the dark
purple area indicates 50% confidence interval and the lighter purple area 
indicates 90% confidence interval.

```{r, fig.show='hide', message==FALSE}
dates <- df %>%
  filter(year(end_date) > 2013) %>%
  group_by(year(end_date), month(end_date)) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

dfts <- ts(dates[, 3], start = c(2014, 0), frequency = 12)

autoplot(hw(dfts, h = 24, seasonal = "multiplicative", level = c(50, 90))) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Application Count") +
  ggtitle("Forecast For The Next 2 Years ")
  
```
